# Improvements

- Fix the jQuery conflicts issues (-core assets etc)
- Find a way to NEVER repeat an identifier twice (parent & sub ids for ex.)
- Find the proper generic names to represent a block/section and a list/group/repeat
- Select the size of the image when assigning it to a section
- Remove the hardcoded 2 limit on most slideshows
